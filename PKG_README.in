SkePU binary release install.
#############################

Either install bin/skepu-tool into /usr/bin/ or update the path env var to
include the directory where skepu-tool is installed. The clang headers and the
skepu headers are needed as well. Install them in /usr/include or any suitable
location.

Running SkePU
=============

SkePU needs the clang headers. If a file example.cpp is to be precompiled, the
following syntax is valid:
$> skepu-tool -dir=<out_dir> [OPTIONS] -- -std=c++11 -I<clang_headers> \
	-I<skepu_headers>
